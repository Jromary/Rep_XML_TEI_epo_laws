            The income and expenditure account and a balance sheet of
            the Organisation shall be examined by auditors whose
            independence is beyond doubt, appointed by the
            Administrative Council for a period of five years, which
            shall be renewable or extensible.

            The audit shall be based on vouchers and shall take place,
            if necessary, in situ. The audit shall ascertain whether

            in a lawful and proper manner and whether the financial
            management is sound. The auditors shall draw up a report
            containing a signed audit opinion after the end of each
            accounting period.
