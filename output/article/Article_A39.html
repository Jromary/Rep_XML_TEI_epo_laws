               See decision of the Administrative Council of 08.06.1984
               on the proportion of renewal fees for European patents to
               be remitted to the EPO (OJ EPO 1984, 296).

         <p>
            Each Contracting State shall pay to the Organisation in
            respect of each renewal fee received for a European patent
            in that State an amount equal to a proportion of that fee,
            to be fixed by the Administrative Council; the proportion
            shall not exceed 75% and shall be the same for all
            Contracting States. However, if the said proportion
            corresponds to an amount which is less than a uniform
            minimum amount fixed by the Administrative Council, the
            Contracting State shall pay that minimum to the
            Organisation.

            Each Contracting State shall communicate to the

            Council considers to be necessary to determine the amount
            of these payments.
