               Amended by the Act revising the European Patent Convention
               of 29.11.2000.

            The European Patent Office may levy fees for any official
            task or procedure carried out under this Convention.

         <h2>(2)
            
         </h2>
         
         <p>
            Time limits for the payment of fees other than those fixed
            by this Convention shall be laid down in the Implementing
            Regulations.

         <h2>(3)
            
         </h2>
         
         <p>
            Where the Implementing Regulations provide that a fee
            shall be paid, they shall also lay down the legal
            consequences of failure to pay such fee in due time.

            The Rules relating to Fees shall
            determine in particular the amounts of the fees and the
            ways in which they are to be paid.
